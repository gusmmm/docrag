# Standard of Care for Renal Replacement Therapy in ICU

## Overview
The standard of care for renal replacement therapy (RRT) in critically ill patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) has evolved significantly from largely empirical practices to individualized, evidence-based strategies. This patient-centered model integrates clinical judgment, therapeutic goals, and available resources to guide the initiation, modality choice, and discontinuation of RRT [gaudry2025renalreplacementtherapy | 10.1007/s00134-025-07987-x].

## Key Findings

### Initiation and Timing
*   **Indications:** RRT initiation is primarily guided by clinical indications rather than a predefined schedule during acute kidney injury (AKI) [gaudry2025renalreplacementtherapy | 10.1007/s00134-025-07987-x].
*   **Urgent Indications:** Immediate RRT is necessary for life-threatening complications such as severe hyperkalemia unresponsive to treatment, severe metabolic acidosis uncorrectable by bicarbonate, refractory fluid overload leading to pulmonary edema, and uremic complications (e.g., encephalopathy, pericarditis) [gaudry2025renalreplacementtherapy | 10.1007/s00134-025-07987-x].
*   **Delayed Initiation:** In the absence of urgent indications, a delayed RRT initiation strategy with close clinical and biological monitoring is preferred. Early initiation has not shown improved survival and may impair renal recovery, while excessive delays (e.g., >3 days of oligo-anuria or serum urea >40 mmol/L) increase mortality. A prudent, indication-driven approach is recommended [gaudry2025renalreplacementtherapy | 10.1007/s00134-025-07987-x].

### Modalities
*   **Available Options:** Modalities include continuous RRT (CRRT), intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), hybrid techniques (e.g., SLED, PIRRT), and peritoneal dialysis in resource-limited settings [gaudry2025renalreplacementtherapy | 10.1007/s00134-025-07987-x].
*   **Modality Choice:** While the optimal choice is debated, KDIGO guidelines recommend CRRT for hemodynamically unstable patients due to better hemodynamic tolerance. However, local expertise, staff training, and resource availability should also guide selection [gaudry2025renalreplacementtherapy | 10.1007/s00134-025-07987-x].
*   **Outcomes:** CRRT, while providing gradual solute and fluid removal, has not consistently shown a survival benefit or improved renal recovery over IHD in large RCTs and meta-analyses. Some studies suggest CRRT may reduce the risk of death or dialysis dependence [gaudry2025renalreplacementtherapy | 10.1007/s00134-025-07987-x].

### Dose
*   **Effectiveness:** RRT dose is a key determinant of effectiveness, influencing small solute clearance and correction of electrolyte/acid-base imbalances [gaudry2025renalreplacementtherapy | 10.1007/s00134-025-07987-x].
*   **Recommendations:** Higher RRT doses have not shown a beneficial effect and may delay renal recovery. Current KDIGO guidelines suggest a CRRT dose of 20-25 mL/kg/h. For IHD or prolonged intermittent RRT, a weekly Kt/V of approximately 3.9 is recommended [gaudry2025renalreplacementtherapy | 10.1007/s00134-025-07987-x].

### Other Considerations
*   Vascular access and anticoagulation strategies are critical for safe and effective RRT delivery [gaudry2025renalreplacementtherapy | 10.1007/s00134-025-07987-x].

### Discontinuation
*   Efforts are ongoing to standardize and optimize RRT discontinuation to refine decision-making [gaudry2025renalreplacementtherapy | 10.1007/s00134-025-07987-x].

## Action Items
*   Clinicians should continue to apply individualized, evidence-based strategies for RRT in the ICU, considering clinical judgment, therapeutic goals, and available resources.
*   Adhere to guidelines for RRT initiation, favoring an indication-driven, delayed approach in non-urgent cases to avoid unnecessary procedures while preventing harmful delays.
*   Select RRT modality based on patient hemodynamic stability, local expertise, staff training, and resource availability.
*   Target recommended RRT doses (e.g., CRRT 20-25 mL/kg/h; IHD/PIRRT weekly Kt/V ~3.9) to ensure effectiveness without adverse effects of higher doses.
