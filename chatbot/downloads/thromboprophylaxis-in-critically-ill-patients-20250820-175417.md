# Thromboprophylaxis in Critically Ill Patients: Conversation Summary

## Overview
This summary outlines the key discussions regarding the initiation, evaluation, and choice of thromboprophylaxis in critically ill patients, including specific considerations for drug selection and dosage, and a note on burn patients.

## Key Findings

### When and How to Initiate Thromboprophylaxis
*   **Initiation:** Decisions for starting thromboprophylaxis in critically ill patients should be based on an individualized and daily risk-benefit evaluation, as standard risk assessment models for venous thromboembolism (VTE) are not effective in this population [arabi2025venousthromboprophylaxis | 10.1007/s00134-025-08009-6].
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Pharmacologic Thromboprophylaxis:** Remains the cornerstone of VTE prevention, primarily involving low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) [arabi2025venousthromboprophylaxis | 10.1007/s00134-025-08009-6].
    *   **Mechanical Thromboprophylaxis:** Intermittent pneumatic compression should be considered for patients with active bleeding or a high risk of major bleeding [arabi2025venousthromboprophylaxis | 10.1007/s00134-025-08009-6].

### Risk-Benefit Evaluation Considerations
Intensivists must carefully balance the benefits of preventing VTE against the risk of bleeding. Factors influencing this evaluation include:
*   **Increased Risk of VTE:**
    *   Older age, obesity, active malignancy, history of venous thromboembolism, history of recent surgery, orthopedic surgery (e.g., total hip or knee replacement), sepsis, lack of pharmacologic prophylaxis, central venous catheter, invasive mechanical ventilation, use of vasoactive medications, COVID-19 [arabi2025venousthromboprophylaxis | 10.1007/s00134-025-08009-6].
*   **Increased Risk of Bleeding:**
    *   Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy, history of major bleeding, history of non-major bleeding, acute kidney injury, shock, chronic liver disease, higher severity of illness (e.g., SOFA score), hospitalization for ischemic stroke, intracerebral hematoma, concomitant antiplatelet agents, concomitant anticoagulants [arabi2025venousthromboprophylaxis | 10.1007/s00134-025-08009-6].
*   **Patient Variability:** Critically ill patients show considerable variability in anticoagulant pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics due to factors like renal function, fluid shifts, and inflammation, implying that a single anticoagulant class or dose may not be optimal for all [arabi2025venousthromboprophylaxis | 10.1007/s00134-025-08009-6].

### Drugs and Doses for Pharmacologic Thromboprophylaxis
| Drug Class | Example/Type | Dosing Recommendations | Considerations |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-----------------------|:---------------|
| Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin (LMWH) | Enoxaparin | Intermediate dose (e.g., 40-60 mg daily) associated with a more favorable risk-benefit profile for VTE prevention compared to lower doses (<40 mg daily) [arabi2025venousthromboprophylaxis | 10.1007/s00134-025-08009-6]. | Cornerstone of VTE prevention; high certainty in reducing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) [arabi2025venousthromboprophylaxis | 10.1007/s00134-025-08009-6]. |
| Unfractionated Heparin (UFH) | | Intermediate-dose (> 10,000 IU total daily dose) was associated with a higher likelihood of major bleeding [arabi2025venousthromboprophylaxis | 10.1007/s00134-025-08009-6]. | May reduce DVT, but with lower certainty compared to LMWH [arabi2025venousthromboprophylaxis | 10.1007/s00134-025-08009-6]. |

### Recommendations for Critically Ill Burn Patients
*   No specific recommendations for critically ill burn patients were found in the provided information. General guidance for critically ill patients, emphasizing individualized and daily risk-benefit evaluations and considering patient variability, is applicable [arabi2025venousthromboprophylaxis | 10.1007/s00134-025-08009-6].
